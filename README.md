# Party Poopers, a Birdy Wirdy card game

This is a phisical card game that I'm **trying to build** for Marco's eighth birthday. He LOVES playing card games like Sushi Go, Exploding Kittens or Machi Koro. I thought it would be awesome if we could design a game together and I could try to make it look _professional_ for him as a birthday present.

And worst case scenario, we are going to have [a great time doing it](https://twitter.com/mamuso/status/1009269124025835520).

SPAGHETTI CODE ALERT!!

I found a bunch of interesting links while I was trying to do it:

## I'd like to say thank you

I'm not a hardcore gamer, and definitively I'm not a game designer. I'd like to say THANKS to Kike, Asier, Nerea and Adri√°n for helping with my questions :)
